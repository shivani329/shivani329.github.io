<h1>Save the Elephants!</h1>

<div>
	<h2>But why?</h2>
	<p>Elephants are beautiful creatures. Sadly, they are numbered. Between the years of 2010 and 2012, 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory tucks in Africa. </p>

	<h2>Aren't there already plenty of organizations for this? </h2>
	<p> Yep! In fact, there is already an organization called Save the Elephants that was created to do just that. I'm just making this page for an assignment, and I love that <br> organization! They sell alot of clothing, raise awareness, have many volunteer or donation opportunities available, and put a lot of research toward how elephants <br> are doing and what they can do to help. They spread awareness and aim to protect the elephants of the world, however they mostly focus on those in Africa. </p>

	<h2>What about the other elephants of the world?</h2>

	<p> Good call! It is important to note that Indian elephants and "domesticated" elephants, like those used in circuses, are just as endangered and at risk as African elephants. <br>Don't fret, there are too, plenty organizations set up to protect them as well.</p>
