	<ul class="first_list">
	<li>1. Elephants are beautiful creatures </li>
	<li> 2. Sadly, they are numbered. </li> 
	<li> 3. Between the years of 2010 and 2012, 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory tucks in Africa. </li>

	<h2 id="headings">Aren't there already plenty of organizations for this? </h2>
	<p id="paragraph1"> Yep! In fact, there is already an organization called Save the Elephants that was created to do just that. I'm just making this page for an assignment, and I love that <br> organization! They sell alot of clothing, raise awareness, have many volunteer or donation opportunities available, and put a lot of research toward how elephants <br> are doing and what they can do to help. They spread awareness and aim to protect the elephants of the world, however they mostly focus on those in Africa. </p>

	<h2 id="headings">What about the other elephants of the world?</h2>

	<p id="paragraph2"> Good call! It is important to note that Indian elephants and "domesticated" elephants, like those used in circuses, are just as endangered and at risk as African elephants. <br>Don't fret, there are too, plenty organizations set up to protect them as well. But, if you are curious, this <a href="differences.html">table</a> shows some of the differences between African and Indian <br> elephants. </p>

	<p id="paragraph3">As far as why I like their website goes...I like how it is pretty interactive. For example, if you go to the page that shows statistics, the numbers load from 0 right in front of you. Its fun! They use a lot of HTML tags that I recognize, and plenty of CSS and javascript. I think it is a pretty effective site. They have a lot to look at, but it is organized really well using many different pages. The scrolling bothers me a bit, but that is just personal preference toward endless scrolling verses block by block. I especially like that they have a copyright AND photo credits page, as a lot of sites don't give visible credit to the photographers who's work is displayed on their sites. I'm a photographer...so..props! </p>
